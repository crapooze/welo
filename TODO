* Embeddings
  - merge the branch
  - use the complex serialization overhead only when needed loaded
* Observations
  - boil-down to a better API
    + too many complications/interface for observe_source (for_hash, _source_ ...)
    + improve the DelayedObservation thing or remove it altogether
  - spec for all these
* Proxies
  - a class like observations to manipulate distant
